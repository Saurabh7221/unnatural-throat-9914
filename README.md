Short Description about pepperfry:
Now among one of the leading online furniture stores in the Indian nation, Pepperfry had been established in 2011, courtesy of Ambreesh Murthy as well as Ashish Shah. The platform focuses on home decor aspects such as lighting, furnishing, housekeeping, dining kitchen appliances and many more.

"Pepperfry is well-capitalised and on the path to achieving profitability," said cofounder Shah. It had last raised a debt of $40 million in November 2021 and had managed to narrow its operational losses by 60% to Rs37 crore in fiscal 2021. In fiscal 2020, operational losses was Rs 95 crore.

We recommend retailers like Joybird and Pottery Barn for well-made couches that you can customize to suit your style, and brands like Burrow and Floyd have more trendy options. Or, for an affordable piece that will be delivered quickly, check out the wide selection at Wayfair or Amazon.
